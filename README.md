A new and exciting way to type on iOS tablets.
MagicSpell aims to assist children with dyslexia in improving spelling skills by typing.

In a nutshell, it is a keyboard with only 10 input keys, allowing you to completely rest your hands on the keyboard with one finger on each key.

You must either use a single or a combination of keys to type a letter. The keys-to-letter mappings conform to the MagicSpell key association system, an intuitive system designed to promote fast learning for beginners.
